## 🏗️ Technologies Used
- **C# (.NET)**  
- **System.Runtime.Serialization** for ID generation  
- Console-based / Form-based interface (depending on implementation)

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Add Students, Books, or Borrow Records using the provided forms or commands.  
2. Edit or Delete any record as needed.  
3. The system automatically generates unique IDs for each entity.  
4. Borrow records calculate return dates and days left automatically.

- **Student** – Represents a student who borrows books  
- **Borrow** – Represents a record of a student borrowing a book

## 📁 Project Goal
This project aims to provide a **simple and extendable library system** that demonstrates good software design practices in **C#**, focusing on **readability**, **maintainability**, and **object-oriented architecture**.
